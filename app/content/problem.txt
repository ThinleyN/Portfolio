What made this system hard?
- The system is built on a legacy framework. 
- It is a huge enterprise level of platform so introducing new methods were not straight forward. 
- Learning curve of the system is steep.

Why multi-tenancy was non-trivial?
- The system is able to run multiple tenancy on a single code base so each changes need to be made carefully as it can affect another tenants.
- Different tenants used different ways of authentications.

What was breaking / risky / slow?
- Adding new tenants and new features were difficult.
- Shipping new features to tenants is manual and slow.

Why a naive solution wouldn’t work?
- Since the system is huge, any changes would have a direct/indirect impacts on other areas of the system.
- It should be maintainable and sustainable for a long run.
